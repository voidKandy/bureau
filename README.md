# A Chat-GPT clone powered by Espionox
This is a repo to demonstrate how to use Espionox to make a Chat-GPT web app clone. To get up and running all you need to do is clone this repo and then put your OpenAi API KEY in 
a `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Although Espionox supports OpenAi and Anthropic models, only OpenAi models are available in this demo. 
If you wish to change anything about the agents made available to you in this app, just change them in the `espx_env/mod.rs` file.

The power of Espionox's Listeners is utilizied to allow you to edit the Agent's memory from directly within the UI!

# Important Considerations
This app is by no means feature complete and If I had more time in my life I would devote it to making this a lot better. This repo is on ice until further notice and won't be receiving any updates in the forseeable future.
