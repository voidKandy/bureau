## A Chat-GPT clone powered by Espionox
This is a repo to demonstrate how to use Espionox to make a Chat-GPT web app clone. To get up and running all you need to do is clone this repo and then put your OpenAi API KEY in 
a `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.


Although Espionox supports OpenAi and Anthropic models, only OpenAi models are available in this demo. 
If you wish to change anything about the agents made available to you in this app, just change them in the `espx_env/mod.rs` file.
